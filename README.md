In this project, we'll work on building an AI chatbot from start-to-finish. We will be using LangChain, OpenAI, and Pinecone vector DB, to build a chatbot capable of learning from the external world using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

We will be using a dataset sourced from the Llama 2 ArXiv paper and other related papers to help our chatbot answer questions about the latest and greatest in the world of GenAI.

By the end of the project we'll have a functioning chatbot and RAG pipeline that can hold a conversation and provide informative responses based on a knowledge base.
